    <h2>Custom Applications</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes there just isn't an existing tool to fit your unique business needs.  We can help you analyze your current processes to architect the perfect solution.  Once we are done, you will have a collection of scenarios you can present to any software development company, include us if you choose, to use as a base for cost and time estimates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the initial lightweight architecture is complete, we can start building the application.  Lazy Gray believes in transparency, so you'll have access to the entire body of work as it is being produced.  This includes everything from high-level task lists to low-level code, you decide which level you prefer.

    <h2>Evaluate Existing Applications</h2>
    <p>
      Let us review your current custom application to help give you insight into what is happening within and <i>around</i> your product.  We call this the ecosystem.  Tools in the ecosystem include analytics, code quality statistics, source code control, error notifications, system uptime and status.

      Do you have a task or series of tasks that you do everyday that requires too much time from you and your team?  Many of these processes can be automated to relieve the strain on your team and allow them to redirect their efforts where they are really needed.
